# Vireon
 
This project, titled Vireon, presents a comparative analysis of three supervised machine learning models — Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Feedforward Neural Network — applied to the task of image-based bird species classification. Vireon is more than a name — it draws inspiration from the vireo, a small, sharp-eyed bird known for its keen perception, subtle beauty, and adaptability. This name was chosen to reflect the essence of the project: a lightweight, intelligent system with a clear vision for recognizing patterns in visual data. The simplicity of the vireo mirrors the elegance of the user-friendly interface, while its precision parallels the neural network's impressive classification performance.

A carefully curated dataset of 811 images across six visually diverse bird species was preprocessed by resizing and flattening each image into a fixed-size feature vector suitable for machine learning input. Each model was then trained and evaluated using key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

The study highlights how different model architectures interpret visual data: The Feedforward Neural Network demonstrated the highest classification accuracy due to its ability to capture complex patterns, while Naive Bayes performed competitively with simplicity and speed. Decision Tree, though less accurate, provided high interpretability and insight into decision logic.

Overall, Vireon showcases the strengths, limitations, and trade-offs of classical and neural models in visual recognition tasks, emphasizing the importance of aligning model choice with the needs of the application — whether that’s interpretability, performance, or computational efficiency.
